# Users Directory Documentation

This directory exists to keep the user's files and Proton's separate. When updating or repairing, Proton will never touch this directory. It is exclusively meant for the user and his or her creations. Such creations include the development side of the website, uploaded media, and miscellaneous files the user wishes to have (hopefully nothing sensitive, though).
